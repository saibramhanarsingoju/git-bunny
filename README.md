Task Manager CLI

A Python-based Command-Line Task Management Tool

Overview

I built this Task Manager CLI to efficiently track and manage daily tasks. The project demonstrates my experience in Python development, including modular code design, file handling, CLI interfaces, and data persistence. The application is lightweight, easy to use, and stores tasks in a JSON file, showcasing maintainable, production-ready scripting.

Features

Add Tasks: Create new tasks with optional due dates to organize your workflow.

List Tasks: View all tasks with clear status indicators (completed or pending) and due dates.

Complete Tasks: Mark tasks as completed to track progress.

Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in a JSON file to maintain data between sessions.

User-Friendly CLI: Intuitive command-line interface for easy navigation and task management.

Technical Highlights

Modular Python functions for adding, listing, completing, and saving tasks.

Uses Python standard libraries: os, json, datetime.

Follows clean code and professional project structure.

Includes .gitignore and proper version control practices.

Installation & Usage

Future Enhancements

Integrate a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL for scalable task management.

Add task categories, priorities, reminders, and deadlines.

Build a web or GUI interface using Flask, FastAPI, or Tkinter.

Implement unit testing and automated scripts for deployment and CI/CD.
